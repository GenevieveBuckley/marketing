Communication Channels
======================

Currently the Dask project communicate with the general public through a few
different media:

1.  The twitter account `@dask_dev <https://twitter.com/dask_dev`_
2.  The blog `blog.dask.org <https://blog.dask.org>`_

Twitter
-------

The twitter account is available to promote information like the following:

1.  New releases or important features that arrive in the Dask project
2.  Important or interesting uses of Dask in the broader community
3.  Documentation, talks, blogposts, or other knowledge artifacts produced
    by Dask contributors in the past that remain relevant but may not be
    broadly known.

However, as with any communication medium we should beware of misusing the
twitter account.  In particular

1.  We tend not to broadcast for-profit promotional or sales material.
    It is important that Dask's brand remains trusted and neutral to corporate
    interests.

    That being said, we do not mind retweeting for-profit products if there is
    not a conflict of interest, and if those products are likely of value to
    our users.  This is often a judgment call.  We endeavor to remove conflicts
    of interest from those making these judgements.

2.  We tend not to over-broadcast, out of respect for those that subscribe.

.. admonition:: TODO

   We need to publish instructions on how external folks can get content
   retweeted.

Blog
----

The Dask blog is published at `blog.dask.org/ <https://blog.dask.org/>`_ with
