Referring to Dask
=================

We refer to Dask as "Dask", capitalizing the first letter and leaving the rest
lower case:

.. raw:: html

    <ul>
    <li>Dask</li>
    <li><strike>dask</strike></li>
    <li><strike>DASK</strike></li>
    </ul>

We do not have to prefix Dask with any organization, however if necessary to
associate Dask with a fiscal entity, we mention that Dask is fiscally
sponsorted by NumFOCUS, or that it is a NumFOCUS sponsored project.

If appropriate, hyperlinks from Dask should point to `dask.org <https://dask.org>`_
in general, or to `docs.dask.org <https://docs.dask.org>`_ if we specifically
want to point readers to documentation.
